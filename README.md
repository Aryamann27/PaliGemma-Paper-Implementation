## ðŸ“– Description

PaliGemma extends contrastive vision-language pretraining with a SigLIP-So400m vision encoder fused into the Gemma-2B autoregressive language model, enabling joint contrastive alignment and generative fine-tuning for robust zero-shot and few-shot performance across visual and multimodal benchmarks.
